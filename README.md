# CopyRunebook
Copies runes from one runebook to another (including rune names)

Simply run the script, target the filled runebook, then target the empty runebook you want to fill.

* Second runebook must have enough space for all of the new runes for the script function as intended.

* You must have enough runes in your backpack.

* The script may overwrite any spare marked runes in your backpack.

* The script will not function properly if you fail at casting Recall or Mark for any reason:
	
   * This may result in skipped runes
